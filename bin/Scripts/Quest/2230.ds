In times like this, there''s nothing quite like having a friend that will be there for you at all times. Have you heard of a #bpet#k? \r\nPeople raise pets to ease the burden, sorrow, and loneliness, because knowing that you have someone, or something in this matter, on your side will really bring a peace of mind. But everything has consequences, and with it comes responsibility...');
